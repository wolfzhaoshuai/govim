Vundle allows to:

    * keep track and configure your scripts right in .vimrc
    * install configured scripts (aka bundle)
    * update configured scripts
    * search all available vim scripts by name
    * clean unused scripts up

Also as a bonus Vundle:

    * manages runtime path of your installed scripts
    * regenerates helptag atomatically
